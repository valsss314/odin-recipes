    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This no-cook banana pudding recipe is easy to make and delicious layered with vanilla wafers and slices of banana. It's the best banana pudding you will ever find (or so I've been told by many)!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cold milk</li>
        <li>1 (5-ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
        <li>1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 (12-ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 (16-ounce) package vanilla wafers</li>
        <li>12 small bananas, sliced or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place milk and pudding mix in a large bowl; beat with a whisk for 2 minutes. Whisk in condensed milk until smooth.</li>
        <li>Stir in vanilla, then fold in whipped topping.</li>
        <li>Arrange a layer of wafers in the bottom of a glass serving bowl. Top with a layer of banana slices, then a layer of pudding mixture; repeat layers until all ingredients are used.</li>
        <li>For best results, chill pudding in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before serving. Top with extra crushed wafers just before serving.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
